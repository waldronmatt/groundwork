# Mascot

I had some fun with chatgpt's dall-e and fed it logos of pnpm, nx, and lerna; the core software this monorepo uses to manage multiple apps and packages. After several prompts and tweaks, I settled on this image of a blue dragon.

The dragon's inner body is constructed of tetris-like blocks that is inspired by pnpm's block-like logo. The blue color palette and wave-like patters on the dragon's scales and tail are inspired by nrwl's wave image embedded in the letter X. The dragon is inspired by lerna/lerna-lite's three-headed dragon.

This fusion of elements in a single dragon symbolizes the cohesive strength and stability these tools provide in managing large-scale codebases.
