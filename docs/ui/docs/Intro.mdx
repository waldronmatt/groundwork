### Version Control

We use Git for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and are familiar with its basics.

### Development Tools

Your development environment is critical. Here are some tools and resources to help you set up your workspace:

- **Code Editor**: We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. It's highly customizable and supports a wide range of extensions.

- **Package Manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is the package manager we use for JavaScript projects. Install it to manage project dependencies.
